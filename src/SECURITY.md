# Security

Please report all security issues privately to
[Daniel Roethlisberger](mailto:daniel@roe.ch).

The maintainers pledge to act on all reported security issues in a timely and
professional manner, working with the reporter to reproduce, understand,
address and disclose vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner.  For critical
vulnerabilities, we will prepare a bugfix release based on the last release,
obtain CVE numbers and notify distributions shipping affected packages in
advance of the release.
